FLaM - Fast Language Modelling toolkit
--------------------------------------
FLaM includes some easy to use tools for common language model tasks.
It is aimed to provide a unicode-safe, fast and easy to use command line interface
for tasks such creating ngram indexes, vocabularies, backoff models etc.


Prerequisites
----------
* cxxtools

  This is abit tricky since the version currently available on Ubuntu repository is lacking some needed headers.
  To install from SVN:

  svn co https://cxxtools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cxxtools/trunk/cxxtools cxxtools
  cd cxxtools
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure && make && sudo make install
